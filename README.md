##  Title

Clothify - Admin Panel: Category Management Module (Frontend)

##  Objective

The goal of this assignment is to build a **React-based Admin Panel** that allows authenticated users to manage product categories (view, add, edit, delete) in a clothing e-commerce platform. The app consumes a secure backend API and displays category data in a structured UI.

##  Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js (Hooks, JSX, Functional Components)
- **Routing:** React Router DOM
- **API Calls:** Axios
- **Auth:** JWT-based authentication with route protection
